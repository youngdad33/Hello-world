<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>My Name is Dominic Ross, and this is my Github Pages test page.<br/>
I have been coding for a while, but never really got anywhere. Now, with a change in circumstances needed and a new job desired, getting back into coding seemed like a good idea.<br/>
I have very basic knowledge of the following languages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>HTML & CSS</li>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>php</li>
    <li>Java</li>
</ul>
<p>My aim this time is to make android apps and learn Java so that I can get a job either in programming, or at least do something I enjoy rather than a monotonous job.</p>
